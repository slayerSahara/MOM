        <h3 class="about">The Problem</h3>
        <p class="about">
            Each year, around 45,000 people commit suicide within the United
            States. For each life taken, 25 more Americans attempt to kill 
            themselves. Suicide is a major problem within our country, but it is 
            not taken as seriously as possible. During this day and time, a majority 
            of the younger generations avoid talking on the phone as much as 
            possible and feel more comfortable instant messaging. These problems
            and more will be addressed through MOM.

        <h3 class="about">Our Mission</h3>
        <p class="about">
            Means of Omitting Melancholy, or MOM for short, is focused on helping
            anyone who may be suffering from depression and/or suicidal tendencies
            through the use of 24/7 online instant messaging between licensed
            volunteers and the victim. It is our goal to be there for anyone
            who may need this service, but can either not afford it or would rather
            instant message than talk on the phone.
